= Exercise 1.0 - Install docker, buildah, skopeo, and podman

== Install docker

.Install docker
[source, bash]
----
$ sudo -i
# yum install -y docker
----

=== Start docker

To start the docker binary and have it managed by link:https://fedoramagazine.org/what-is-an-init-system/[`systemd`]
we first need to enable it and tell systemd that we want it to run a boot time.
Then to start the docker daemon right away we use the start command.

[source, bash]
----
systemctl enable docker
----

[source, bash]
----
systemctl start docker
----

[source, bash]
----
systemctl status docker
----

Once docker daemon starts successfully you should see a similar output as below.

== Install buildah, skopeo, and podman

The docker tooling requires a daemon (service) to operate.  There are alternative CLI tools which provide focused separation of the docker command's features and extend their capabilities.  The following three commands will be used throughout this workshop.

- Buildah - used to build Open Container Initiative (OCI) format or docker format container images without the need for a daemon.
- Podman - provides the ability to directly run container images without a daemon.  Podman can pull container images from a container registry if they are not available locally
- Skopeo -  offers features for pulling and pushing containers to registries.  Moving containers between registries is supported.  Container image inspection is also offered and some introspective capabilities can be performed without first downloading the container itself.

[source, bash]
----
yum -y install buildah skopeo podman
