# What Are Reports?

In Red Hat CloudForms, reports have been constructed to help you view the most commonly requested and significant data. From here, you can also create reports if you have appropriate access. CloudForms Management Engine provides a large group of default reports organized into categories. Each category has its own set of subfolders.
