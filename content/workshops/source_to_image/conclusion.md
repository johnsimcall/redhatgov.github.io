# Congratulations
You have gone through a methodical process to develop container technology that is custom to a framework, yet repeatable.  We have:

1. Run the application from the command line to understand what it does and how it is supposed to behave.

2. Containerized the applicaiton.

3. Built Source-to-Image mechanisms that allow us to inject raw source code to be built inside the container.

4. Created an OpenShift template to make repeated deployments easier.
