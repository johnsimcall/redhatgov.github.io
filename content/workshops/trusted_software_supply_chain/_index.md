# Trusted Software Supply Chain
The notion of trusted software supply chain is that of applying a production line approach to software that includes building increasing levels of assurance before marking an artifact as ready to deploy to production. Using a build orchestration tool such as Jenkins as the foundation of automation, the various stages of the deployment lifecycle are represented -- from development, multiples types of testing, user acceptance, staging, to production release. Each phase will have a policy defining the stage gate for success and will generate a documentation artifact that will later be used as part of an ATO package.
