# Lab 7

* Duration: 30 mins

To wrap up this workshop, we'll be deploying the underlying VMs that are associated with an OpenShift deployment (3 master, 3 infrastructure, and 3 application nodes). The goal here is to show an automated approach at utilizing the hyperconverged infrastructure to do a full deployment of an OpenShift cluster.
