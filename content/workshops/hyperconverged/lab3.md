# Lab 3

* Duration: 30 mins

To mimic a security upgrade, an update is available for each of the RHHI hosts. Upgrade the RHHI cluster to the latest.

1. Upgrade the host that has the VM you created in Lab 2 running on it. In this example, we are upgrading host ‘rhhi3.localdomain’
  - In the left pane, click on on “Compute” and then “Hosts”
  - You’ll see the <img src="../images/lab3-live-migrate-1.png" "Login" /> picture next to hosts that have an upgrade available
  - Highlight ‘rhhi3.localdomain’
  - Click the ‘Installation’ button
  - Click ‘Upgrade’
