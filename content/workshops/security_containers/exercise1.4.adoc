= Exercise 1.4 - CGroups

== CGroups

The https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Resource_Management_Guide/ch01.html[Device Cgroup] is primary in isolating and limiting containers to their own shares of CPU, memory, disk I/O, network, etc., other wise it will be denied.

== Memory Limits

Docker uses Cgroups to control and limit the amount of system resources a container can use. This will help to protect a system runing from potential application memory leaks or Denial of Service DoS attacks that can consume all available memory and take down a system. By running containers with special docker flags we can restrict the amount of memory a container is able to consume even when a application is trying to consume more memory.


[source, bash]
----
sudo docker run -d --name fedora1 fedora sleep 15m
----

We can check using the `https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats/#description[docker stats]` command and see that this instance `fedora1` has no memory limits placed on it.


[source, bash]
----
sudo docker stats --no-stream fedora1
----

{{< panel_group >}}
{{% panel "Result" %}}

[source, bash]
----
CONTAINER           CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O
fedora1             0.00%               2.601 MB / 1.927 GB   0.13%               648 B / 648 B       2.81 MB / 0 B
----

{{% /panel %}}
{{< /panel_group >}}



Now we can place a memory limit on this second container `fedora2` with the docker flag `https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/resource_constraints/[--memory]`.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker run -d --name fedora2 --memory 150m fedora sleep 15m
----

Now lets check again using the `docker stats` command to see the memory restrictions it has placed on this new container.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker stats --no-stream fedora1 fedora2
----

{{< panel_group >}}
{{% panel "Result" %}}

[source, bash]
----
CONTAINER           CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O
fedora1             0.00%               2.601 MB / 1.927 GB   0.13%               1.296 kB / 648 B    2.81 MB / 0 B
fedora2             0.00%               2.597 MB / 157.3 MB   1.65%               648 B / 648 B       2.81 MB / 0 B
----

{{% /panel %}}
{{< /panel_group >}}



Now you know how to restrict the amount of memory a container is able to use.

=== Clean Up

Lets clean up for the next exercise.

Kill all running containers
[source, bash]
----
sudo docker kill $(sudo docker ps -q)
----

Delete exited containers
[source, bash]
----
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aqf status=exited)
----

Make sure everything is cleared out.
[source, bash]
----
sudo docker ps -a
----


== CPU Limits

By default, each container’s access to the host machine’s CPU cycles is unlimited. Various constraints can be set to limit a given
container’s access to the host machine’s CPU cycles. Docker provides several flags for setting limits on how many shares of a processor a container is able to use. Previously we looked at memory restrictions and setting a maximum ceiling for memory usage, CPU limits are set by shares. We can define share weights for each container and slit the available shares between the containers for a single processor.

Lets run a container with `512` limit of CPU shares.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker run -d --name fedora1 --cpuset-cpus 0 --cpu-shares 512 dkuffner/docker-stress --cpu 10
----

Now lets see how many shares this container is using.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker stats --no-stream fedora1
----



{{< panel_group >}}
{{% panel "Result" %}}

[source, bash]
----
CONTAINER           CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O
fedora1             99.66%              3.088 MB / 1.927 GB   0.16%               648 B / 648 B       3.077 MB / 0 B
----

{{% /panel %}}
{{< /panel_group >}}


CPU shares are defined as a value between 0-1024, however when idle the container will use all available shares until another process needs to use the existing shares. Let's run a example where another container needs to run and we divide up the shares equally.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker run -d --name fedora2 --cpuset-cpus 0 --cpu-shares 512 dkuffner/docker-stress --cpu 10
----

Now lets see how the processor shares get divided between the two.

[source, bash]
----
sudo docker stats --no-stream fedora1 fedora2
----


{{< panel_group >}}
{{% panel "Result" %}}

[source, bash]
----
CONTAINER           CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT     MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O
fedora1             49.56%              3.092 MB / 1.927 GB   0.16%               1.296 kB / 648 B    3.06 MB / 0 B
fedora2             49.91%              3.088 MB / 1.927 GB   0.16%               648 B / 648 B       3.06 MB / 0 B
----

{{% /panel %}}
{{< /panel_group >}}




Now you know how to control the amount of CPU shares a container is able to use.

=== Clean Up

Lets clean up for the next exercise.

Kill all running containers
[source, bash]
----
sudo docker kill $(sudo docker ps -q)
----

Delete exited containers
[source, bash]
----
sudo docker rm $(sudo docker ps -aqf status=exited)
----

Make sure everything is cleared out.
