= Exercise 1.6 - Read Only Containers

image::readonly.png[]

Now that you've gotten a sense of Linux Kernel Capabilities, let's move on to
Readonly Containers.

Imagine a scenario where an application gets compromised. The first thing the
bad guy wants to do is to write an exploit into the application, so that the
next time the application starts up, it starts up with the exploit in place. If
the container was read­only it would prevent leaving a backdoor in place and be
forced to start the cycle from the beginning.

Docker added a read­only feature but it presents challenges since many
applications need to write to temporary directories like  `/run` or `/tmp` and
when these directories are read­only, the apps fail. Red Hat’s approach
leverages https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmpfs[`tmpfs`].

From Wikipedeia:

*tmpfs* _is a common name for a temporary file storage facility on many
Unix-like operating systems. It is intended to appear as a mounted file system,
but stored in volatile memory instead of a persistent storage device._

It's a nice solution to this problem because it eliminates data exposure on the
host.

*Bottom line: As a best practice, run all applications in production with this
mode.*

== Read only Containers

=== Step 1:

Run a read­only container and specify a few writable file systems using the
­`tmpfs` option.

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run --rm -it --name readonly --read-only --tmpfs=/run --tmpfs=/tmp rhel7.3 bash
----

=== Step 2:

Now, try to the following. What fails and what succeeds? Why?

.Inside the container try these commands
[source,bash]
----
mkdir /newdir
----

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /run/newdir
----

[source,bash]
----
mkdir /tmp/newdir
----

Now exit the container

.Exit the container
[source,bash]
----
exit
----
