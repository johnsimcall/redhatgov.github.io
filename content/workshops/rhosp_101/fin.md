# That's it!
Hopefully, these labs provided you some idea of how to perform common tasks within the OpenStack environment.  And hopefully, you have a deeper understanding of how Infrastructure-as-a-Service works.

# Get even deeper

Here are some good resources to continue learning OpenStack:

* [OpenStack Foundation](https://www.openstack.org/)
* [TryStack.org - The easiest way to try OpenStack](http://trystack.org/)
* [RDO Project - Our midstream open source OpenStack for RHEL variants](https://www.rdoproject.org/)

There are two ways to get started with RDO: TripleO Quickstart and PackStack

* [TripleO Quickstart](https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/)
* [PackStack](https://www.rdoproject.org/install/packstack/)
